## Project Description
[A sleek, responsive web dashboard to track monthly income, budgets, and expenses with visual analytics.]

## The Problem statement
[The Challenge: Financial Literacy and Fragmented Tracking
In an era of digital transactions, many individuals—especially students and young professionals—struggle to maintain a clear overview of their monthly finances. Common challenges include:

Lack of Real-Time Awareness: Relying on memory or checking bank apps manually often leads to overspending before the month ends.

Budgeting Ambiguity: Without a visual representation of "Budget vs. Actual" spending, users find it difficult to identify which categories (like Food or Shopping) are draining their savings.

Data Friction: Many existing financial tools are overly complex, requiring steep learning curves or paid subscriptions, which discourages consistent tracking.]

## The Solution
[ExpensePro addresses these pain points by providing a centralized, lightweight, and intuitive dashboard.

Categorized Visualization: It utilizes a dynamic doughnut chart to instantly show the percentage of income spent on different lifestyle categories.

Proactive Budgeting: It features an automated warning system that alerts users when they reach 80% or 100% of their set limit, enabling better decision-making before the money is gone.

Accessibility & Privacy: By utilizing localStorage, the tool ensures user data remains private on their own device while staying accessible without the need for a complex backend.]

## Technologies / Components Used
### For Software:
Languages used: * HTML5: Used for the semantic structure of the dashboard and forms.

CSS3: Used for the layout, responsive design, and Dark Mode transitions.

JavaScript (ES6): Used for all application logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.

Frameworks used: * None (Vanilla JavaScript) — This project is built using a lightweight, no-framework approach to ensure high performance and fast load times.

Libraries used: * Chart.js: A powerful JavaScript library used to render the interactive, dynamic Doughnut charts that visualize expense categories.

Google Fonts (Poppins): To provide a modern and professional typography style.

### Tools used: * VS Code: (Recommended) Primary code editor for development.

Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting.

Chrome/Edge DevTools: For debugging JavaScript logic and testing CSS responsiveness.

LocalStorage API: A web-standard tool used for client-side data persistence without a database.

## Features
Feature 1: Interactive Dashboard with Real-Time Calculations
The app automatically calculates and displays your Total Spent, Remaining Budget, and Current Balance instantly as you add or delete expenses, providing an immediate overview of your financial health.

Feature 2: Visual Data Analytics with Chart.js
It features a dynamic Doughnut Chart that categorizes your spending (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.). This allow users to visually identify which areas of their life are consuming the most resources.

Feature 3: Smart Budget Monitoring & Progress Bar
A color-coded progress bar tracks your spending against your set budget. It includes a Smart Warning System that changes the bar's color (Green to Red) and displays alert messages when you approach or exceed your financial limits.

Feature 4: Data Persistence & Portability
The project uses LocalStorage to keep your data saved in the browser even after a page refresh. Additionally, it includes an Export to CSV tool, allowing users to download their expense history for use in external spreadsheet software like Excel.

Feature 5 (Bonus): User Experience & Customization
The UI includes a built-in Dark Mode toggle for comfortable use in low-light environments, along with a Search and Filter system that lets users find specific transactions or view expenses by a specific category.
